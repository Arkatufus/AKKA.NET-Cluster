Please create an issue in our GitHub at [https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net].. 
Serializer Id [6] is used to instantiate 
[Akka.Remote.Serialization.MessageContainerSerializer, Akka.Remote]. 
You can add it by adding a fallback to your ActorSystem configuration by using
[RemoteConfigFactory.Default()].
